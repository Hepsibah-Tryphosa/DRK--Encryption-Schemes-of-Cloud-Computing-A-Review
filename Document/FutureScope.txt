As the security is the main concern in distributed Cloud environment, in this present research a secure Cloud System is provided. This proposed security system environment provides the multiple storage and security features based on FDH. The file level functionality provided in this work includes storage, retrieval, forwarding and key sharing. The security is provided using authentication, authorization, file system storage, secure file communication, session specific communication and group communication. The work can be extended in the future under different aspects. The presented system is defined specifically for public and private Cloud access in hybrid and generalized environment in the future.
